## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Consideration for functionality and security is relevant in nearly every stage of development. It's imprtant to gather requirements with adequete amounts of details without any misundertanding or oversight. Developers should follow secure coding practices like santizing unser inputs, encompassing data within secure boundary, or storing vulnerable data like passwords in a safe space. After a program is developed , thorough testing must be done. Developers must write unit tests to consider every type of input and edge cases. It is important to get feedback, and have your code peer reviewed to discover any flaws. Besides unit testing, integration testing and system testing is also very important. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I think the best way to understand user needs is by gaining as much details as possible, and keepig a stream of communication active with the client. If there are competetiors of the system, it is imparative to evaluate them and see how it is designed for inspiration and understanding. 

## How do I approach designing software?

When designing a software, my first goal is to gather all the requirements and make sure that I fully understand what is being asked. After this, I try to outline the needs from a business standpoint to then design a high-level outline of the software. After the design, I check for all the resources, tools and software needed. I then break down the over all design into smaller chunks to work on.
